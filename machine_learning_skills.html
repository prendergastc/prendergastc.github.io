<p>The 2018 Woolsey Fire burned thousands of acres of land in Southern California. In the past, analysts had to manually review aerial images to determine the scope of building damage. Deep learning can automate this process. In this ArcGIS lab, you will play the role of a wildfire analyst. First, you will prepare aerial imagery and training sample data. Then, you will train a deep learning model to classify buildings as damaged or undamaged. Finally, you will apply and evaluate the accuracy of your model.</p>

<p>Distance analysis helps answer a fundamental question about geographic data: How far apart are different locations? In this course, you will learn that "how far apart" means much more than the number of kilometers between places on a mapâdistance can also include the effect of the landscape on movement. You will learn how distance analysis can create more sophisticated models of near and far. You will also apply distance analysis concepts to answer real-world questions about movement across the landscape.</p>

<p>Spatial data science allows analysts to extract deeper insight from data using a comprehensive set of analytical methods and spatial algorithms, including machine learning and deep learning techniques. This course explores the application of spatial data science to uncover hidden patterns and improve predictive modeling. You'll work with powerful analytical tools in Esri's ArcGIS software and learn how to integrate popular open data science packages into your analyses.</p>
<h3 id="section-1-introduction-to-spatial-data-science">SECTION 1  â¢  Introduction to Spatial Data Science</h3>
<p>Explore how spatial data, tools, and analysis techniques augment traditional data science. Understand  that âspatialâ means more than x,y coordinates and that place-based context reveals patterns in data that otherwise may be hidden. Start applying data engineering and visualization techniques in ArcGIS Pro and ArcGIS Notebooks.</p>
<h3 id="section-2-the-spatial-approach-to-predictive-analysis">SECTION 2  â¢  The Spatial Approach to Predictive Analysis</h3>
<p>Prediction is fundamental to data science. See how incorporating spatial properties into modeling workflows deepens understanding of data and adds a widely used machine learning approach, to solve problems. Train and evaluate a model, then use it to generate robust predictions.</p>
<h3 id="section-3-finding-optimal-locations-using-suitability-models">SECTION 3  â¢  Finding Optimal Locations Using Suitability Models</h3>
<p>Apply widely used spatial analysis techniques to answer this universal question asked by all kinds of organizations: Where is the best location for <fill blank="" in="" the="">? Perform a weighted overlay analysis that considers and ranks multiple suitability criteria. Learn how to transform data using functions to more completely represent suitability impact.</fill></p>
<h3 id="section-4-pattern-detection-and-clustering">SECTION 4  â¢  Pattern Detection and Clustering</h3>
<p>Does a pattern have meaning or is it a product of random chance? ArcGIS includes a suite of tools to help analysts identify patterns and clusters in data and determine if they are meaningful. Learn how to apply statistical clustering methods to analyze patterns in space as well as time. Create a spacetime cube, then use space-time pattern mining tools to explore spatiotemporal trends and determine where and when high and low clusters occur.</p>
<h3 id="section-5-object-detection-with-deep-learning">SECTION 5  â¢  Object Detection with Deep Learning</h3>
<p>Take a deep dive into extracting information from massive data using deep learning. Learn how to automate the process of detecting objects and identifying features from imagery. Practice preparing training sample data, then use a neural network to train an object detection model.</p>

<p>This course will introduce the learner to applied machine learning, focusing more on the techniques and methods than on the statistics behind these methods. The course will start with a discussion of how machine learning is different than descriptive statistics, and introduce the scikit learn toolkit through a tutorial. The issue of dimensionality of data will be discussed, and the task of clustering data, as well as evaluating those clusters, will be tackled. Supervised approaches for creating predictive models will be described, and learners will be able to apply the scikit learn predictive modelling methods while understanding process issues related to data generalizability (e.g. cross validation, overfitting). The course will end with a look at more advanced techniques, such as building ensembles, and practical limitations of predictive models. By the end of this course, students will be able to identify the difference between a supervised (classification) and unsupervised (clustering) technique, identify which technique they need to apply for a particular dataset and need, engineer features to meet that need, and write python code to carry out an analysis.</p>

<p>This course builds on the foundational concepts and skills for TensorFlow taught in the first two courses in this specialisation, and focuses on the  probabilistic approach to deep learning. This is an increasingly important area of deep learning that aims to quantify the noise and uncertainty that is often present in real world datasets. This is a crucial aspect when using deep learning models in applications such as autonomous vehicles or medical diagnoses; we need the model to know what it doesn't know.</p>
<p>You will learn how to develop probabilistic models with TensorFlow, making particular use of the TensorFlow Probability library, which is designed to make it easy to combine probabilistic models with deep learning. As such, this course can also be viewed as an introduction to the TensorFlow Probability library.</p>
<p>You will learn how probability distributions can be represented and incorporated into deep learning models in TensorFlow, including Bayesian neural networks, normalising flows and variational autoencoders. You will learn how to develop models for uncertainty quantification, as well as generative models that can create new samples similar to those in the dataset, such as images of celebrity faces.</p>
<p>You will put concepts that you learn about into practice straight away in practical, hands-on coding tutorials, which you will be guided through by a graduate teaching assistant. In addition there is a series of automatically graded programming assignments for you to consolidate your skills.</p>
<p>At the end of the course, you will bring many of the concepts together in a Capstone Project, where you will develop a variational autoencoder algorithm to produce a generative model of a synthetic image dataset that you will create yourself.</p>
<p>This course follows on from the previous two courses in the specialisation, Getting Started with TensorFlow 2 and Customising Your Models with TensorFlow 2. The additional prerequisite knowledge required in order to be successful in this course is a solid foundation in probability and statistics. In particular, it is assumed that you are familiar with standard probability distributions, probability density functions, and concepts such as maximum likelihood estimation, change of variables formula for random variables, and the evidence lower bound (ELBO) used in variational inference.</p>

<p>For a lot of higher level courses in Machine Learning and Data Science, you find you need to freshen up on the basics in mathematics - stuff you may have studied before in school or university, but which was taught in another context, or not very intuitively, such that you struggle to relate it to how itâs used in Computer Science. This specialization aims to bridge that gap, getting you up to speed in the underlying mathematics, building an intuitive understanding, and relating it to Machine Learning and Data Science.</p>
<p>In the first course on Linear Algebra we look at what linear algebra is and how it relates to data. Then we look through what vectors and matrices are and how to work with them.</p>
<p>The second course, Multivariate Calculus, builds on this to look at how to optimize fitting functions to get good fits to data. It starts from introductory calculus and then uses the matrices and vectors from the first course to look at data fitting.</p>
<p>The third course, Dimensionality Reduction with Principal Component Analysis, uses the mathematics from the first two courses to compress high-dimensional data. This course is of intermediate difficulty and will require Python and numpy knowledge.</p>
<p>At the end of this specialization you will have gained the prerequisite mathematical knowledge to continue your journey and take more advanced courses in machine learning.</p>
<p>Applied Learning Project</p>
<p>Through the assignments of this specialisation you will use the skills you have learned to produce mini-projects with Python on interactive notebooks, an easy to learn tool which will help you apply the knowledge to real world problems. For example, using linear algebra in order to calculate the page rank of a small simulated internet, applying multivariate calculus in order to train your own neural network, performing a non-linear least squares regression to fit a model to a data set, and using principal component analysis to determine the features of the MNIST digits data set.</p>

<p>In this course on Linear Algebra we look at what linear algebra is and how it relates to vectors and matrices. Then we look through what vectors and matrices are and how to work with them, including the knotty problem of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and how to use these to solve problems. Finally  we look at how to use these to do fun things with datasets - like how to rotate images of faces and how to extract eigenvectors to look at how the Pagerank algorithm works.</p>
<p>Since we're aiming at data-driven applications, we'll be implementing some of these ideas in code, not just on pencil and paper. Towards the end of the course, you'll write code blocks and encounter Jupyter notebooks in Python, but don't worry, these will be quite short, focussed on the concepts, and will guide you through if youâve not coded before.</p>
<p>At the end of this course you will have an intuitive understanding of vectors and matrices that will help you bridge the gap into linear algebra problems, and how to apply these concepts to machine learning.</p>

<p>This course offers a brief introduction to the multivariate calculus required to build many common machine learning techniques. We start at the very beginning with a refresher on the ârise over runâ formulation of a slope, before converting this to the formal definition of the gradient of a function. We then start to build up a set of tools for making calculus easier and faster. Next, we learn how to calculate vectors that point up hill on multidimensional surfaces and even put this into action using an interactive game. We take a look at how we can use calculus to build approximations to functions, as well as helping us to quantify how accurate we should expect those approximations to be. We also spend some time talking about where calculus comes up in the training of neural networks, before finally showing you how it is applied in linear regression models. This course is intended to offer an intuitive understanding of calculus, as well as the language necessary to look concepts up yourselves when you get stuck. Hopefully, without going into too much detail, youâll still come away with the confidence to dive into some more focused machine learning courses in future.</p>

<p>This intermediate-level course introduces the mathematical foundations to derive Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a fundamental dimensionality reduction technique. We'll cover some basic statistics of data sets, such as mean values and variances, we'll compute distances and angles between vectors using inner products and derive orthogonal projections of data onto lower-dimensional subspaces. Using all these tools, we'll then derive PCA as a method that minimizes the average squared reconstruction error between data points and their reconstruction.</p>
<p>At the end of this course, you'll be familiar with important mathematical concepts and you can implement PCA all by yourself. If youâre struggling, you'll find a set of jupyter notebooks that will allow you to explore properties of the techniques and walk you through what you need to do to get on track. If you are already an expert, this course may refresh some of your knowledge.</p>
<p>The lectures, examples and exercises require:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Some ability of abstract thinking</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Good background in linear algebra (e.g., matrix and vector algebra, linear independence, basis)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Basic background in multivariate calculus (e.g., partial derivatives, basic optimization)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Basic knowledge in python programming and numpy</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This course is substantially more abstract and requires more programming than the other two courses of the specialization. However, this type of abstract thinking, algebraic manipulation and programming is necessary if you want to understand and develop machine learning algorithms.</p>
<p>What you'll learn</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Implement mathematical concepts using real-world data</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Derive PCA from a projection perspective</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Understand how orthogonal projections work</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Master PCA</p>
</li>

<h1 id="project-description">Project Description</h1>
<p>The project proposes a geodatabase design to organize a large number of standalone feature classes and tables into a smaller number of feature datasets. It covers approximately 75 feature classes and three standalone tables. </p>
<p>When grouping the feature classes and tables into a feature dataset, the design considers topological relationships that may exist between the individual feature classes, and any possible relationships between the feature classes and tables. </p>
<p>The design applies the following considerations to group feature classes and tables into feature datasets:</p>
<ul>
<li>Logical or thematic groupings</li>
<li>Feature classes which may need to be edited together (e.g. participate in a topology)</li>
<li>Share the same coordinate system</li>
<li>Other advanced feature dataset elements like utility networks</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="geodatabase-design-report">Geodatabase Design Report</h1>
<p>The final project design report includes recommended definitions and groupings for feature datasets, feature classes, and tables.</p>

<p>The shapefile was created by comparing the 1986 land use/land cover (LU/LC) layer from the geographical information systems (GIS) database to 1995/97 color infrared (CIR) imagery and delineating areas of change. Work for this dataset was done by Aerial Information Systems, Inc., Redlands, CA.  LU/LC changes were captured by adding new line work and attribute data for the 1995/97 land use directly to the base data layer. All 1986 LU/LC polygons and attribute fields remain in this dataset, so that change analysis can be undertaken from this one layer. The classification system used was a  modified Anderson et al., classification system. An impervious surface (IS) code was also assigned to each LU/LC polygon based on the percentage of impervious surface within each polygon as of 1995/97. Minimum mapping unit (MMU) is 1 acre. </p>

Arcade was initially built to create custom labels, symbolization, and pop-up windows, but it has been developed over time to include a significantly wider range of capabilities. It can now be used in ArcGIS applications such as ArcGIS Dashboards and ArcGIS Field Maps to format elements and create conditional rules to control form visibility. Arcade can also be employed in other environments to create attribute rules, calculate new field values, evaluate feature constraints, perform geoanalytics, and configure geotriggers, among many other uses.

Arcade is used throughout ArcGIS, and many expressions can be used interchangeably between different applications and devices. For instance, the expression that you create to generate a custom label in ArcGIS Pro can also be used to create a similar label in ArcGIS Online and ArcGIS Enterprise.

### SECTION 1  • Geography Matters

This lesson introduces spatial analysis and all the different ways that location affects our lives. It identifies the tools and data used to explore spatial questions and problems.


### SECTION 2  • Understanding and Comparing Places

Different locations host different physical and cultural features and populations. Locations can be described and summarized with attributes and can be compared to one another.


### SECTION 3  • Determining How Places are Related

How you arrange your data affects how you understand locations. Choosing the appropriate scale and combining meaningful data sets can help reveal relationships.


### SECTION 4  • Finding the Best Locations and Paths

Topology defines spatial relationships between features. Querying these relationships along with specific attributes helps find optimal locations for activities, structures and routes.


### SECTION 5  • Detecting and Quantifying Patterns

Information on the distribution patterns of a phenomenon can guide policies that encourage positive activities and deter negative ones.

### SECTION 6  • Making Predictions

Models help predict the situation in locations where data is not available and help analysts understand the underlying causes of patterns."

The third course, Dimensionality Reduction with Principal Component Analysis, uses the mathematics from the first two courses to compress high-dimensional data. This course is of intermediate difficulty and will require Python and numpy knowledge.

At the end of this specialization you will have gained the prerequisite mathematical knowledge to continue your journey and take more advanced courses in machine learning.

Applied Learning Project

Through the assignments of this specialisation you will use the skills you have learned to produce mini-projects with Python on interactive notebooks, an easy to learn tool which will help you apply the knowledge to real world problems. For example, using linear algebra in order to calculate the page rank of a small simulated internet, applying multivariate calculus in order to train your own neural network, performing a non-linear least squares regression to fit a model to a data set, and using principal component analysis to determine the features of the MNIST digits data set.

Then we look through what vectors and matrices are and how to work with them, including the knotty problem of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and how to use these to solve problems. Finally  we look at how to use these to do fun things with datasets - like how to rotate images of faces and how to extract eigenvectors to look at how the Pagerank algorithm works.

Since we're aiming at data-driven applications, we'll be implementing some of these ideas in code, not just on pencil and paper. Towards the end of the course, you'll write code blocks and encounter Jupyter notebooks in Python, but don't worry, these will be quite short, focussed on the concepts, and will guide you through if you’ve not coded before.

At the end of this course you will have an intuitive understanding of vectors and matrices that will help you bridge the gap into linear algebra problems, and how to apply these concepts to machine learning.

We start at the very beginning with a refresher on the “rise over run” formulation of a slope, before converting this to the formal definition of the gradient of a function. We then start to build up a set of tools for making calculus easier and faster. Next, we learn how to calculate vectors that point up hill on multidimensional surfaces and even put this into action using an interactive game. We take a look at how we can use calculus to build approximations to functions, as well as helping us to quantify how accurate we should expect those approximations to be. We also spend some time talking about where calculus comes up in the training of neural networks, before finally showing you how it is applied in linear regression models. This course is intended to offer an intuitive understanding of calculus, as well as the language necessary to look concepts up yourselves when you get stuck. Hopefully, without going into too much detail, you’ll still come away with the confidence to dive into some more focused machine learning courses in future.

We'll cover some basic statistics of data sets, such as mean values and variances, we'll compute distances and angles between vectors using inner products and derive orthogonal projections of data onto lower-dimensional subspaces. Using all these tools, we'll then derive PCA as a method that minimizes the average squared reconstruction error between data points and their reconstruction.

At the end of this course, you'll be familiar with important mathematical concepts and you can implement PCA all by yourself. If you’re struggling, you'll find a set of jupyter notebooks that will allow you to explore properties of the techniques and walk you through what you need to do to get on track. If you are already an expert, this course may refresh some of your knowledge.

The lectures, examples and exercises require:

1. Some ability of abstract thinking

2. Good background in linear algebra (e.g., matrix and vector algebra, linear independence, basis)

3. Basic background in multivariate calculus (e.g., partial derivatives, basic optimization)

4. Basic knowledge in python programming and numpy

This course is substantially more abstract and requires more programming than the other two courses of the specialization. However, this type of abstract thinking, algebraic manipulation and programming is necessary if you want to understand and develop machine learning algorithms.

What you'll learn

* Implement mathematical concepts using real-world data

* Derive PCA from a projection perspective

* Understand how orthogonal projections work

* Master PCA

It’s popular around the world, given its strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance. In this course, Janani Ravi dives into advanced topics in PostgreSQL. After showing how to install and set up PostgreSQL, Janani shows you how to work with geospatial data, which allows you to specify geographic objects such as locations, lines, and polygons, all on a geographic map, and also supports location-based queries like distance computation and area computation. Next, learn about performing full-text search operations, and how to work with triggers, which let you set up an automated execution of a function when a certain type of operation is performed. Finally, Janani explores transactions, which allow you to bundle multiple steps into a single, all-or-nothing operation.

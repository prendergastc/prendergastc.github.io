You will learn

* What a spatial database is and why you would want to use one.
* What SQL is, why you would want to use it, and how it can be applied to geospatial concepts.
* How to install PostGIS locally for development purposes and how to access a production version via a network or the internet.
* How to load your spatial data into PostGIS and access it from a variety of clients, especially QGIS
* The basics of SQL for both spatial and non-spatial queries
* How to validate data and control user access with the tools built-in to PostGIS
* Optimizing your queries for the best performance

All you need for this course is a basic understanding of QGIS and Python. We will be using the editor included with QGIS to write scripts.

Python scripts are much simpler than a full-blown QGIS plugín and the material in this course is focused on the GIS professional who is looking to use python scripts to improve their productivity, rather than the professional programmer. In my work, I have found this knowledge to be indispensable and I can't imagine working in GIS without having some level of scripting ability.  I believe that by the end of this course you will feel the same way."

You'll get free access to the full analytical capabilities of ArcGIS Online, Esri's cloud-based mapping and analytics platform.

### SECTION 1  • Geography Matters

This lesson introduces spatial analysis and all the different ways that location affects our lives. It identifies the tools and data used to explore spatial questions and problems.


### SECTION 2  • Understanding and Comparing Places

Different locations host different physical and cultural features and populations. Locations can be described and summarized with attributes and can be compared to one another.


### SECTION 3  • Determining How Places are Related

How you arrange your data affects how you understand locations. Choosing the appropriate scale and combining meaningful data sets can help reveal relationships.


### SECTION 4  • Finding the Best Locations and Paths

Topology defines spatial relationships between features. Querying these relationships along with specific attributes helps find optimal locations for activities, structures and routes.


### SECTION 5  • Detecting and Quantifying Patterns

Information on the distribution patterns of a phenomenon can guide policies that encourage positive activities and deter negative ones.

### SECTION 6  • Making Predictions

Models help predict the situation in locations where data is not available and help analysts understand the underlying causes of patterns."

Once, only cartographers made maps. Today, anyone can. Still, cartographers can teach people to make better maps, just as chefs can show people how to prepare better meals. With coaching from accomplished cartographers and practical, hands-on exercises, you'll become a smarter mapmaker, ready to go beyond the defaults and produce engaging maps that communicate with impact.


### SECTION 1  •  Let’s Get Mapping

Consider the value and purpose of cartography as science and art. Get set up with ArcGIS® Pro, ArcGIS Online, and exercise data. Use ArcGIS Pro to design a small-format, multiscale topographic map, using generalization tools and scale-dependent symbology. Use map layouts for composition. Add contextual detail, insets, legends, and elements.


### SECTION 2  •  Maths for Map Makers

Explore how coordinate systems, transformations, and projections affect your map’s message. Deal with the effects of projections and data classification methods on thematic maps. Design and publish a custom basemap in a nonstandard projection to support thematic data. Build attribute-driven symbology. Publish a multiscale web map and app.


### SECTION 3  •  The Language of Graphics

See how generalization, symbology, and color affect your story. Explore generalization techniques that reduce feature complexity for smaller-scale displays. Create a variety of thematic maps, including choropleth, proportional symbol, value-by alpha, and multivariate maps. Change symbology and use transparency in creative ways.


### SECTION 4  •  Labels and Composition

Learn basic typography concepts, label placement, and map composition. Set up a palette of label styles for different features and explore options for positioning them around other map details. Create a map layout that includes a range of elements. Use ArcGIS expressions to define labels in innovative ways.


### SECTION 5  •  Going 3D

Consider how to best use the z dimension to represent data for both reference and thematic maps. Use 3D symbology and develop a sense of when 3D adds value to your map. Build 3D scenes and vary the way features are represented using attributes and dynamic symbology.

### SECTION 6  •  Mapping Movement and Change

Use the time-aware and animation controls in ArcGIS Pro to design maps that show temporal change. Direct an animated movie to map change; add captions and dynamic overlay information; and publish in a range of popular, shareable formats. Create a display of small multiples for an infographic poster.

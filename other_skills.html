<p>In this career-oriented program, students are trained in the interrelated fields of environmental resource management (sustainable multiple-use management of our fundamental environmental resources—air, water, land, food and extracted materials) and pollution prevention. The training received is multidisciplinary, covering the areas of law and regulation, public health, economics and science and technology, and includes coursework covering a variety of practical management tools that employers look for. Upon completion, students are prepared for either employment as environmental management or pollution prevention specialists (in a wide range of positions and settings, including working for business, government and nonprofit organizations) or for transfer to four-year degree programs in Environmental Studies or related majors. This degree is the last step in a career ladder with the first step being a Certificate of Achievement and the second being a Certificate of Achievement-Advanced.</p>

<p>The A.S. degree in Energy Management and Building Science will prepare students for new and emerging career opportunities in energy management technology, building energy audit, facilities management, building design and sustainability and renewable energy systems. Completion of the degree program provides students with a skilled knowledge of energy efficiency principles and prepares them for careers in managing and monitoring energy efficient buildings. The program curriculum is aligned with professional certifications offered by the International Facilities Management Association (IFMA), including Facilities Management Professional (FMP) and Sustainable Facilities Professional (SFP). Students will also be well prepared for the certification test for Renewable (Solar) Energy Professional offered by the North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners (NABCEP).</p>
<p>Our program focuses on the technical aspects of Zero Net Energy (ZNE) building systems by utilizing sustainable building materials, energy efficient lighting, HVAC and building control systems, and by implementing green building and architectural theories, standards and principles such as passive solar design, LEED, and renewable energy generation and storage.</p>
<p>Additional program focus is on building code compliance, building energy audits and benchmarking, building commissioning, total cost of ownership, and individual personal skill development in program management, calculating energy management return on investment and technical report writing. You have the option to take your classes in the very first USGBC LEED Platinum building in the California Community College system- The Kirsch Center for Environmental Studies- the "Building That Teaches"!! We truly believe the Kirsch Center and the De Anza Campus should be a living laboratory for student learning.</p>

<p>The interdisciplinary Facility and Sustainable Building Management degree aligns with the requirements set by the facility management industry for qualified facility management professionals. Students will be educated and provided on-the-job work experience. Students will understand the cross-functional aspects of a successful facility manager and will be further educated on the roles facility managers play, the basics of building operations and maintenance, building sustainability and work management within the facility manager job function. The International Facility Management Association (IFMA) estimates the average age of practicing facility managers is more than 49 years old. IFMA also forecasts that 30% to 50% of practicing facility managers will retire within the next 10 years. This indicates a pending employment gap and a need for younger, well-educated and qualified facility management professionals. IFMA has turned to California community colleges to help fill this gap. The Facility and Sustainable Building Management certificates and degrees will prepare students for careers in building sustainability, space planning, environmental health and safety, energy efficiency, sustainable landscaping, real estate, property management, human resources and other business-related job functions such as marketing, sales and accounting.</p>
<p>Focuses on the business aspects of making buildings productive, efficient, sustainable, and environmentally safe by implementing effective building operations and maintenance procedures, automated building monitoring and management systems, strategic facilities planning, total cost of ownership and insuring employee safety and security by overseeing and managing effective workplace communications and cross organizational collaboration.</p>
<p>There's an unfilled demand for over 3,500 trained Facility Management professionals in the SF Bay Area. Take your classes in the very FIRST California Community College and State Accredited Facility Management AS degree program and the ONLY Facility Management Degree Program in California listed in the International Facility Management Association's (IFMA) Academic Registry. A well paid and rewarding job is already waiting for you.</p>

<p>Project management and Agile management is everywhere. It's developing software to improve a health care process. It's managing the construction of a new apartment complex. It's deployed in expanding a company's market share. It's employed in your professional and personal lives. Project management is applying specific skills and tools to meet a project requirement. Project managers are the key to delivering those projects on time, on budget and within scope. You may be doing these types of tasks without the project manager designation. Interested in gaining a foundational base to build on your already employable skills? If you're already working in project management, there are always new skills and methodologies to learn or brush up on. We have courses and certificates that meet your professional needs—whether you're looking to change careers, add project manager to your résumé or enhance your skill set. Our program curricula are designed to teach theory and practical skills to enable you to change careers or advance in your current position. Classes are offered in classroom and multiple online formats to meet the needs of working professionals.</p>

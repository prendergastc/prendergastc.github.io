<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<p>This project applied Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to assess elephant habitat suitability and human-elephant 
conflict patterns in the Narok and Kajiado districts of Kenya. Using ArcGIS Pro, the study combines environmental 
layers—such as protected areas, land use, and rainfall—with human-related data including roads, towns, and documented 
conflict locations.</p>
<p>The goal of this spatial analysis project is to identify potential sites to set aside as elephant habitat conservation 
zones in southwestern Kenya. The analysis identifies preferred habitats based on rainfall, land cover and land use, then
subtract out restricted lands and buffer zones. The data for this analysis was obtained from the International Livestock
Research Institute (ILRI), the United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP) and other sources in Kenya. </p>
<p>The project's output includes a series of maps which model suitable elephant habitat, with recommended areas for further
study where new protected areas could potentially be established. These maps enable visualization and analysis of 
spatial relationships, leading to the development of a ModelBuilder workflow. This model automates key geoprocessing 
tasks such as buffering, selection, and intersection, ultimately producing a detailed suitability map highlighting areas
most favorable for elephant movement and conservation.</p>
<p>The analysis considers the location of existing protected areas, distribution of rainfall, locations of reported human 
elephant conflicts, travel distance from the Mara river, and areas of suitable elephant habitat to recommend locations 
for further study as potential new protected areas.</p>
<p>By integrating data management, spatial analysis, and cartographic design, the project demonstrates how GIS can support 
real-world conservation planning. The outputs provide clear insights into where habitat is most suitable, where risks of
conflict are highest, and where strategic conservation action can be most effective.</p>
<h1 id="protected-areas">Protected Areas</h1>
<p>The Protected Areas Map serves as the foundational visualization for subsequent spatial analyses in the project, 
incorporating key geographic datasets related to protected areas, administrative boundaries, hydrology, and 
transportation infrastructure. The map includes several key data layers essential for the analysis. The 
<strong>ProtectedAreas</strong> layer outlines designated conservation zones such as national parks, forest reserves, and national 
reserves within the study area. The <strong>Narok_Kajiado</strong> layer defines the administrative boundaries of the two districts 
serving as the primary focus of the project. The <strong>Rivers</strong> layer represents major hydrological features across the 
region, while the <strong>Roads_WFP</strong> layer provides detailed information on the transportation network, based on 
classifications from the World Food Programme. Together, these layers form the geographic foundation for modeling 
potential elephant habitat zones.</p>

<h1 id="problem-elephants">Problem Elephants</h1>
<p>The Problem Elephants Map expands the Protected Areas Map to incorporate additional geographic context and newly created
data relevant to modeling elephant habitat. This map builds on the foundational layout and includes the national 
boundary, capital city, and field-collected elephant conflict locations. The map introduces the <strong>Outside_boundary</strong> 
layer, which shows the national extent of Kenya and provides geographic reference for the location of the Narok and 
Kajiado districts within the country. The <strong>Nairobi</strong> layer is added and projected to match the map’s coordinate system,
then symbolized and labeled to clearly mark Kenya's capital city. A new feature class, <strong>ProblemElephantsFC</strong>, is 
created from a table of latitude and longitude values representing observed instances of elephant-related conflict. 
These point features are projected, symbolized, and incorporated into the map to visualize human-elephant interaction 
sites. Overall, this map prepares the project for more detailed analysis by integrating key reference and incident data 
into the spatial framework.</p>

<p><a href="./images/kenya_elephants/pdf/problem_elephants.pdf">PDF file</a></p>
<h1 id="rainfall">Rainfall</h1>
<p>The Rainfall Map emphasizes the spatial distribution of rainfall as a key environmental factor in identifying suitable 
elephant habitat. The map integrates categorized precipitation data to highlight variations in annual rainfall, which 
can significantly influence vegetation patterns, water availability, and overall habitat quality for elephants.</p>
<p>The <strong>Rainfall</strong> layer is displayed using a precipitation-themed color ramp and categorized by ranges such as 
“200–400 mm” to “1600–2000 mm.” Although the data values are stored as text, the unique value symbology method is used 
to visually differentiate rainfall zones. The categories are arranged in ascending order to clearly show the transition 
from low to high rainfall areas. To ensure the rainfall patterns remain prominent while still allowing visibility of 
other features, the layer is set to 50% transparency and positioned below key thematic layers.</p>
<p>In addition to rainfall, the map includes layers for <strong>ProtectedAreas</strong>, <strong>Narok_Kajiado</strong> boundaries, <strong>Roads_WFP</strong>, 
<strong>Major_Towns</strong>, <strong>Nairobi</strong>, and <strong>ProblemElephantsFC</strong>. Each of these layers is symbolized to maintain visual clarity 
while supporting the map’s central focus on rainfall. By combining environmental and human-related data with rainfall 
distribution, the map provides a comprehensive view of the region's spatial dynamics, forming a strong foundation for 
subsequent habitat suitability analysis.</p>

<h1 id="breakout-from-mara-river">Breakout from Mara River</h1>
<p>The Breakout from Mara River Map highlights the Mara region within Narok District, with a specific focus on areas where 
elephants are likely to move outside the Maasai Mara National Reserve—a phenomenon referred to as the “Mara breakout.” 
The map is designed to support analysis of elephant movement patterns beyond protected boundaries and into surrounding 
landscapes, where human-elephant conflict is more likely to occur.</p>
<p>At the center of the map is the Maasai Mara National Reserve, prominently located in southwestern Narok. This protected 
area is symbolized to distinguish it from adjacent reserves and land uses. Surrounding the reserve are several key 
spatial layers that contextualize the breakout dynamics:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>ProblemElephantsFC</strong> shows recorded locations of human-elephant conflict, many of which appear clustered outside the
reserve’s formal boundaries, indicating zones where elephants are leaving protected lands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Roads_WFP</strong> and <strong>Nairobi</strong> layers provide infrastructure and settlement context, illustrating potential barriers or
corridors to elephant movement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Narok_Kajiado</strong> district boundaries and the <strong>ProtectedAreas</strong> layer help frame jurisdictional and conservation 
zones.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Labels are applied to key features—including protected area names, major towns, and the Maasai Mara itself—to aid 
interpretation. The focus on the Mara breakout area transforms this map from a general regional overview into a 
targeted analytical tool for identifying high-risk zones where conservation planning and human-wildlife conflict 
mitigation efforts may be needed most.</p>

<p><a href="./images/kenya_elephants/pdf/breakout_from_mara.pdf">PDF file</a></p>
<h1 id="human-elephant-conflicts">Human Elephant Conflicts</h1>
<p>The Human Elephant Conflicts Map centers on visualizing human-elephant conflict (HEC) locations in relation to key 
environmental and infrastructure features. The primary focus is to organize and prepare the map for future analytical 
work by saving symbology and layout configurations that clearly highlight areas of conflict between human settlements 
and elephant movements.</p>
<p>At the heart of the map is the <strong>ProblemElephantsFC</strong> layer, which displays geolocated incidents of human-elephant 
conflict. These points represent events such as crop raiding, fence destruction, and other forms of human-wildlife 
interaction. The spatial distribution of these incidents—particularly those occurring outside protected areas like the 
Masai Mara National Reserve—offers critical insights into where elephants are leaving conservation zones and entering 
human-dominated landscapes.</p>
<p>Supporting layers include <strong>ProtectedAreas</strong>, <strong>Roads_WFP</strong>, and <strong>Narok_Kajiado</strong>. These features provide essential 
context: roads and rivers suggest potential barriers or corridors; administrative boundaries help define jurisdiction; 
and protected areas indicate zones where conflict is expected to be lower. </p>
<p><a class="mybox" href="images/kenya_elephants/png/human_elephant_conflicts.png" title="Human Elephant Conflicts"><img alt="Human Elephant Conflicts" class="image-process-large-photo" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 800px, (min-width: 992px) 650px, (min-width: 768px) 718px, 100vw" src="images/kenya_elephants/png/derivatives/large-photo/800w/human_elephant_conflicts.png" srcset="images/kenya_elephants/png/derivatives/large-photo/600w/human_elephant_conflicts.png 600w, images/kenya_elephants/png/derivatives/large-photo/800w/human_elephant_conflicts.png 800w, images/kenya_elephants/png/derivatives/large-photo/1600w/human_elephant_conflicts.png 1600w"/></a></p>
<p><a href="./images/kenya_elephants/pdf/human_elephant_conflicts.pdf">PDF file</a></p>
<h1 id="problem-elephants-with-landcover">Problem Elephants with Landcover</h1>
<p>The Problem Elephants with Landcover Map explores the relationship between land use patterns and different types of 
human-elephant conflict (HEC). It is designed to visually and analytically link where conflicts occur with the kind of 
land they affect—providing valuable insight into how land cover and human activity influence elephant movement and 
conflict zones.</p>
<p>Central to the map is the <strong>ProblemElephantsFC</strong> layer, a set of point features representing recorded elephant conflict 
incidents. Each point contains attribute data describing the type of conflict, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>HEC</strong> (general human-elephant conflict),</li>
<li><strong>Farm</strong> (crop damage or field intrusion),</li>
<li><strong>Fence</strong> (infrastructure destruction),</li>
<li>and other site-specific issues.</li>
</ul>
<p>These incidents are labeled by type, making it easier to distinguish the nature of conflicts across the landscape. 
For example, farming-related conflicts may cluster near agricultural zones, while fence-related incidents might occur at
park boundaries or near settlement edges.</p>
<p>Overlaying this layer is the LandUse data, which provides detailed classification of the landscape (e.g., forest, 
bushland, grassland, agriculture). This layer enables spatial comparison between land cover types and conflict 
locations, revealing how elephants interact with different human-altered environments. In particular, the map helps 
identify whether agricultural areas are more prone to conflict, and whether certain land use categories appear to
attract or deter elephant activity.</p>
<p>Additional contextual layers—such as <strong>Roads_WFP</strong> and <strong>Narok_Kajiado</strong> boundaries—support interpretation by providing 
infrastructure and jurisdictional context.</p>
<p>This map serves as a foundational tool for understanding how land use influences the type and frequency of 
human-elephant conflict, and it informs more targeted recommendations for land management and conflict mitigation in 
affected communities.</p>
<p><a class="mybox" href="images/kenya_elephants/png/problem_elephants_with_landcover.png" title="Problem Elephants with Landcover"><img alt="Problem Elephants with Landcover" class="image-process-large-photo" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 800px, (min-width: 992px) 650px, (min-width: 768px) 718px, 100vw" src="images/kenya_elephants/png/derivatives/large-photo/800w/problem_elephants_with_landcover.png" srcset="images/kenya_elephants/png/derivatives/large-photo/600w/problem_elephants_with_landcover.png 600w, images/kenya_elephants/png/derivatives/large-photo/800w/problem_elephants_with_landcover.png 800w, images/kenya_elephants/png/derivatives/large-photo/1600w/problem_elephants_with_landcover.png 1600w"/></a></p>

<h1 id="suitable-elephant-habitat">Suitable Elephant Habitat</h1>
<p>The Suitable Elephant Habitat Map represents a critical step in the elephant habitat conservation project by visualizing
suitable habitat areas based on a combination of environmental and human-related criteria. The central focus of the map 
is to highlight areas within Narok and Kajiado where elephants are most likely to thrive, using a multi-criteria 
suitability model.</p>
<p>The core layer featured on this map is the Suitability layer, which results from merging several input factors 
through a vector overlay analysis. Inputs include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Rainfall: as a proxy for vegetation and water availability,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Distance from roads: to reduce the likelihood of human disturbance or conflict,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Distance from towns: to avoid high human population density,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Land use: to prioritize natural vegetation and exclude urban or agricultural areas.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The resulting suitability layer provides a visual summary of where conservation zones could be extended or reinforced 
based on spatial patterns of environmental favorability.</p>
<p>Supporting layers such as ProtectedAreas, Narok_Kajiado, ProblemElephantsFC, Major_Towns, and Roads_WFP are included to 
contextualize the model output. These layers help assess how well existing protected areas align with suitable zones and
where potential conflicts or gaps may occur.</p>
<p>This map marks the transition from exploratory spatial analysis to a decision-support product, capable of guiding 
conservation strategies, land-use planning, or policy recommendations related to elephant habitat protection.</p>

<h1 id="protected-areas-and-elephant-habitat">Protected Areas and Elephant Habitat</h1>
<p>The Protected Areas and Elephant Habitat Map focuses on analyzing the spatial relationship between protected areas and 
surrounding elephant habitat, with the goal of identifying regions where conservation efforts can be reinforced or 
expanded. Using geoprocessing tools such as buffers, intersect, and clip, the map models zones of potential habitat 
suitability and assesses their connectivity to existing protected areas.</p>
<p>At the core of this analysis is the <strong>ProtectedAreas</strong> layer, which includes national parks, forest reserves, and other 
conservation zones. The map uses buffer zones around these areas to identify surrounding landscapes that may serve as 
ecological transition zones or dispersal corridors for elephants. These buffers help visualize areas that are not 
formally protected but may play a critical role in habitat connectivity and wildlife movement.</p>
<p>Supporting layers include <strong>Narok_Kajiado</strong> district boundaries and <strong>Roads_WFP</strong>, which provide administrative and 
infrastructure context.</p>
<p>The map effectively highlights regions where protected areas are either fragmented or insufficiently connected, offering
spatial insight into where new conservation efforts could be most impactful. This is a key step toward building a more 
resilient elephant habitat network that reduces conflict and promotes long-term ecological viability.</p>
<p><a class="mybox" href="images/kenya_elephants/png/protected_areas_and_elephant_habitat.png" title="Protected Areas and Elephant Habitat"><img alt="Protected Areas and Elephant Habitat" class="image-process-large-photo" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 800px, (min-width: 992px) 650px, (min-width: 768px) 718px, 100vw" src="images/kenya_elephants/png/derivatives/large-photo/800w/protected_areas_and_elephant_habitat.png" srcset="images/kenya_elephants/png/derivatives/large-photo/600w/protected_areas_and_elephant_habitat.png 600w, images/kenya_elephants/png/derivatives/large-photo/800w/protected_areas_and_elephant_habitat.png 800w, images/kenya_elephants/png/derivatives/large-photo/1600w/protected_areas_and_elephant_habitat.png 1600w"/></a></p>

<h1 id="recommended-study-areas">Recommended Study Areas</h1>
<p>The final map Study Areas Map centers on the recommended study areas within the Narok and Kajiado districts, providing a 
comprehensive and automated spatial analysis of potential elephant habitat using ModelBuilder. The map visualizes 
results from a model that integrates multiple environmental and human impact variables to evaluate habitat suitability 
specifically within these two key districts in southwestern Kenya.</p>
<p>At the core of the map are the <strong>Narok_Kajiado</strong> boundaries, which define the project’s geographic focus. The 
<strong>ProtectedAreas</strong>within these districts—such as the Maasai Mara National Reserve and adjacent forest reserves—serve as 
critical anchors for elephant populations. The analysis evaluates how suitable habitat extends beyond these formally 
protected zones, identifying connected or fragmented patches of land that could serve as corridors or priority 
conservation areas.</p>
<p>Using ModelBuilder, the map displays output from a weighted overlay model that includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Proximity to protected areas,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Natural land use classes within Narok and Kajiado,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Buffer zones around roads, towns, and conflict points,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rainfall distribution relevant to forage and water access.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The map overlays infrastructure layers including <strong>Roads_WFP</strong> and <strong>Major_Towns</strong> to highlight the tension between 
habitat and human settlement.</p>
<p>The map delivers district-specific insights into where elephants are most likely to find safe and suitable habitat, and 
where human-elephant interactions are most likely to occur. It supports localized decision-making by identifying

<h1 id="modelbuilder">ModelBuilder</h1>
<p>The ModelBuilder model developed for this project automates the process of identifying suitable elephant habitat by 
integrating multiple spatial criteria. Built in ArcGIS Pro, the model streamlines complex geoprocessing tasks into a 
clear, repeatable workflow that ensures analytical consistency and allows for efficient scenario testing and refinement.</p>
<p>The model incorporates several important input layers. The <strong>land use</strong> data is reclassified to highlight natural 
vegetation types such as forests, bushland, and grasslands, while minimizing the suitability of human-modified 
landscapes like urban areas and agricultural fields. The <strong>ProtectedAreas</strong> layer is used to identify existing 
conservation zones and adjacent lands that may serve as viable extensions of elephant habitat. Rainfall data is included
to emphasize areas with favorable environmental conditions, particularly those that support vegetation and water 
resources.</p>
<p>To account for human pressures, the model includes buffer zones around roads and towns, representing areas where human 
activity may interfere with elephant movement or increase the risk of conflict. These buffer areas help define exclusion
zones, directing attention to regions with lower human influence. The ProblemElephantsFC layer, which contains mapped 
locations of past human-elephant conflict incidents, supports the analysis by identifying areas of concern and providing
a real-world reference for evaluating model outputs.</p>
<p>Throughout the model, tools such as Buffer, Select by Location, Intersect, and Erase are used to define suitable and 
unsuitable areas based on proximity and spatial relationships. The final output is a vector-based feature layer showing 
geographic zones within Narok and Kajiado that meet all criteria for potential elephant habitat. These areas can be 
further analyzed, mapped, or used for decision-making regarding conservation planning, land use policy, or conflict 
mitigation.</p>
<p>By encapsulating all geoprocessing steps into a single, modular design, the ModelBuilder model allows users to quickly 
adjust parameters, update inputs, or replicate the analysis in other regions. It provides a transparent and flexible 
framework for habitat suitability assessment, making it a powerful tool for supporting long-term elephant conservation 
efforts within the defined study areas.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>This project demonstrates the effective use of GIS tools and spatial analysis techniques to support elephant habitat 
conservation planning within the Narok and Kajiado districts of Kenya. By integrating environmental variables such as 
land use and rainfall with human-related factors like roads, towns, and conflict locations, the analysis provides a 
data-driven approach to identifying suitable habitat areas and potential conflict zones.</p>
<p>Through the use of ModelBuilder, the workflow becomes not only efficient and repeatable but also transparent—allowing 
conservation practitioners to adjust inputs, re-run scenarios, and expand the model to new regions or species. The 
layers, tools, and maps developed throughout the project work together to visualize where elephants are most likely to 
thrive and where human-elephant conflict risks are greatest.</p>
<p>The final products—including a suitability map, well-organized spatial data layers, and a reusable geoprocessing model
—offer a solid foundation for evidence-based decision-making. These outputs can support land-use planning, conflict 
mitigation strategies, and targeted conservation interventions. Ultimately, the project highlights the power of GIS in 
balancing ecological needs with human development pressures, providing practical tools to help ensure the long-term 
survival of elephants in shared landscapes.</p>
<h1 id="appendicies">Appendicies</h1>
<h2 id="appendix-i-geoprocessig-tools-used">Appendix I -- Geoprocessig Tools Used</h2>
<p>The ModelBuilder workflow relies on a series of vector-based geoprocessing tools in ArcGIS Pro to automate the 
identification of suitable elephant habitat within the Narok and Kajiado districts. These tools are used to evaluate 
spatial relationships between features—such as proximity, overlap, and land classification—and to construct a logical, 
step-by-step analysis framework that can be repeated or adapted for future studies.</p>

<p>One of the core tools used in the model is <strong>Buffer</strong>, which creates distance zones around features such as roads, 
towns, and protected areas. Buffers help define areas of influence—either to avoid (e.g., buffers around towns where 
human disturbance is high) or to prioritize (e.g., areas near existing protected zones). These buffer zones form the 
basis for further spatial analysis.</p>
<p>The <strong>Select Layer By Location</strong> tool is used to identify features that spatially intersect, are within a certain 
distance of, or are contained within other features. This is especially useful for filtering land use categories or 
conflict points that fall within buffer zones or protected areas.</p>
<p>The <strong>Clip</strong> tool is used to restrict datasets to the defined study area—namely, the Narok_Kajiado district 
boundary—ensuring that the analysis focuses only on relevant geographic areas. Similarly, <strong>Erase</strong> is used to remove 
features from specific zones, such as excluding unsuitable land uses or areas too close to towns or roads.</p>
<p><strong>Intersect</strong> is employed to identify areas where multiple suitable conditions overlap, such as natural land cover types 
that also fall within proximity to protected areas and outside zones of human conflict. This tool helps refine the 
output to only those areas that meet all necessary criteria.</p>
<p>Additionally, the <strong>Merge</strong> and <strong>Union</strong> tools may be used to combine multiple compatible features into a single layer, 
particularly when inputs from various sources are prepared separately but must be considered together in the final 
analysis.</p>
<p>These tools are sequenced within ModelBuilder to run automatically, eliminating the need for manual repetition and 
reducing the chance of error. By combining spatial logic with automation, the model delivers a robust, scalable 
approach to habitat suitability analysis that aligns with conservation goals and supports decision-making at the local 
level.</p>
<h1 id="appendix-ii-key-layers">Appendix II -- Key Layers</h1>
<p>The habitat suitability model incorporates a set of well-defined vector data layers, each playing a distinct role in 
analyzing and identifying appropriate zones for elephant conservation. These layers represent both environmental 
features that support elephant movement and survival, and human-related elements that influence conflict and habitat 
fragmentation. Below is a description of each key layer used in the analysis:</p>

<h3 id="protectedareas">ProtectedAreas</h3>
<p>This polygon layer includes formal conservation zones such as national parks, national reserves, and forest reserves. 
These areas represent known elephant habitats and are prioritized in the model for their ecological integrity and legal 
protection status. Proximity to protected areas is used as a positive factor in identifying nearby land with high 
habitat value.</p>
<h3 id="landuse">LandUse</h3>
<p>This layer classifies the landscape into various land cover types, such as forest, bushland, grassland, agricultural 
areas, and urban zones. Natural land use categories are favored in the model as suitable elephant habitat, while 
developed or cultivated lands are considered unsuitable due to potential for conflict and limited forage availability.</p>
<h3 id="roads_wfp">Roads_WFP</h3>
<p>Provided by the World Food Programme, this line feature layer includes primary, secondary, and tertiary roads, as well 
as tracks and trails. Roads are associated with human activity and disturbance, so the model creates buffer zones around
them to reduce habitat suitability in these areas.</p>
<h3 id="major_towns">Major_Towns</h3>
<p>This point feature layer includes significant urban centers within and near the Narok and Kajiado districts. Towns are 
used to define areas of high human density and infrastructure, which elephants tend to avoid. Buffer zones around towns 
are excluded from potential habitat areas to reduce overlap between elephants and human settlements.</p>
<h3 id="nairobi">Nairobi</h3>
<p>The capital city is included as a reference point in the map for orientation and scale. Although not directly part of 
the suitability analysis, Nairobi is labeled and symbolized to provide context within the broader study region.</p>
<h3 id="narok_kajiado">Narok_Kajiado</h3>
<p>This polygon layer defines the administrative boundaries of the two focus districts—Narok and Kajiado. It serves as the 
study area mask, ensuring that all spatial analysis and outputs are limited to the target region.</p>
<h3 id="problemelephantsfc">ProblemElephantsFC</h3>
<p>This point feature class was created from tabular data recording human-elephant conflict incidents, including types such
as “Farm,” “Fence,” and general “HEC.” These points are used to identify conflict hotspots and assess the overlap 
between high-suitability areas and real-world elephant activity outside protected areas.</p>
